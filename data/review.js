        review : "Excellent food! I am a big supporter of quality Asian and seafood restaurants in the area, and this place certainly delivers. They have a developed menu with all of the classic rolls and plenty of signature rolls…Their rolls were excellent with great quality fish, the service fast and the staff friendly! If you're in Cityline, Firewheel, or Springpark this is your new go-to sushi place. Go in-person or order it for delivery, you can't go wrong here.",

        review : "We order their poke bowls and egg rolls for delivery all the time when I’m working from home and they are BOMB. It’s so fresh and always perfect every time. The egg rolls are our FAV. We’ve added some sushi a few times too and also yum! Will have to stop by someday.",

        review : "It can be difficult to find an affordable sushi place that is also of good quality. I think that among the sushi places I've been to while staying in the Plano area, Sushi Rollin' may very well just be the best bang for your buck. Not only that but the service was great, I had a nice experience when I went in to order take-out. The restaurant was spotless, the hostess was very kind and capable of her job for sure. I was impressed by the speed at which the food was made, and it was also accurate…It seems like this place is very new so I hope they do well! I don't see why they wouldn't succeed.",

        review : "I found this sushi restaurant online and have ordered delivery from them for lunch at my work office. My coworker and I order from them at least 3 times a month for lunch. Every time we love the sushi we order. It’s fresh and the presentation is always nice. When we experienced an issue with one of our food items being forgotten in our delivery, the manager went above and beyond to correct their error, and delivered our food to our office himself. I was so impressed by the way he handled the issue. Definitely my favorite sushi spot!!! Such great customer service and the food is amazing!",

        review : "We enjoy to go out. Yesterday we  visited this magnificent place which we didn’t know before. We passed a lovely time there with first-rate food and a courteous team and an impressive chief cook. We  added this restaurant in our phone list  and we shall certainly visit again very soon. We highly recommend.",
